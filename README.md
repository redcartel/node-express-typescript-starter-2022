# Typescript & Express API Template

*"A minimally opinionated typescript & express starter for 2022"*

A minimal but useful typescript & express starter template with some default middleware and testing.

`npm run dev` - Run the development server.

`npm test` - Run tests.

`npm test:watch` - Run tests when files update.

`npm run build` - Builds the server.

`npm start` - Runs the server.
## Default endpoints:

A `GET` request to `/` will respond with the value of NODE_ENV or an empty response if the environment is production.

A `POST` request to `/` will echo any json sent in the request body.
