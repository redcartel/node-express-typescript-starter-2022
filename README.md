# Node Express & Typescript Starter for 2022 & 2023

_"A minimally opinionated typescript & express starter for 2022 & 2023"_

This template is also used by my utility create-my-express on npm.

## Usage:

You should copy `.env.sample` to `.env` and then:

`npm run dev` - Run the development server.

`npm test` - Run tests.

`npm run test:watch` - Run tests when files update.

`npm run build` - Builds the server.

`npm start` - Runs the server.

## Default endpoints:

A `GET` request to `/` will respond with a description of the application.

A `POST` request to `/` will echo any json sent in the request body.

## Help out

Feedback and contributions are very welcome.
